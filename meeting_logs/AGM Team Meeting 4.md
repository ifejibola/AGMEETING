**Project**

Progress:

- Adam has started work in the forked github repo, showed his progress during the meeting
- Have gotten wireframe for the landing page, client wants us to work on that for now

Problems:

- No database to work off yet, might get it Friday
- Unfamiliarity with react for a few of us
- Jira dashboard is down, client hasn’t decided if they will put it back up yet

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Each of us will start work on one of the pages on the pdf:
- Adam is doing the first as he is the most familiar with react
- Riley will work on the interactions page
- Mason will work on the agenda page
- Reid will work on the vault page

Goals for next time:

- Have each page at least partially started by Friday
