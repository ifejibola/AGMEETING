**Project**

Progress:

- We’ve each finished our part in the second wireframe sprint, we now need to prepare for the second peer evaluation
- We discussed our plan on what we would do for the second peer evaluation in this meeting

Problems:

- Our peer evaluation will be barren in our case considering we have only worked on front end design
- No new wireframe yet to work on

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- For the clean up required for the peer evaluation:
- Adam will handle the aesthetics for the session page, overview page, and login page
- Riley will handle the aesthetics interactions page, and the routing for content message
- Reid will handle the passing of the login to the dashboard
- Mason will handle the save button functionality for the settings page, and (maybe) the settings page layout

- For the peer evaluation, we split up the work required as follows:
- Adam will present on Wednesday for session 1
- Adam will evaluate the LIMS session 2 think aloud for team 1 on Wednesday, and the Woo Woo think aloud for team 0 on Friday
- Riley will present on Wednesday for session 2
- Riley will evaluate the Checklick session 3 think aloud for team 2 on Friday, and the Cyclops session 3 think aloud for team 2 on Friday
- Reid will present on Friday for session 1
- Reid will evaluate the Woo Woo session 2 think aloud for team 2 on Wednesday, and the Ethics Dashboard session 2 feedback for team 1 on Wednesday
- Mason will present on Friday for session 2
- Mason will evaluate the Ethics Dashboard session 1 think aloud for team 1 on Wednesday, and the LIMS session 2 feedback for team 2 on Wednesday

Goals for next time:

- Have our peer evaluation finished, and work on the follow up video and pdf document
- Hopefully start work on our third wireframe by next week
