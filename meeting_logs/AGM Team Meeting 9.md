**Project**

Progress:

- Ife has told us to work on a database for this week, we can work in whatever software we choose, he suggested PSQL
- Ife has asked us to present what we have for the next weeks meeting since we told him about our ER diagram

Problems:

- The peer testing 3 will be on Wednesday of next week, it is an informal presentation of our plan and what we have so far, however we don’t currently have a plan for this. The hope is that it is like peer evaluation 1 in that we’d need a PowerPoint and a video

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Adam and Riley will work on database research and socket.io research for node.js
- Reid and Mason will work on reviewing what Ife has done for us on GitHub, and planning what we need for peer evaluation 3 and 4

Goals for next time:

- We hope that back-end work can finally start by next week after Ife is satisfied with our database design
