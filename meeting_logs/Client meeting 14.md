- Ife asked for us to show what we’ve done so far with our user based authentication
- Team 1 demonstrated what they’ve done first, as of now a user can choose who they want to log in as. There is currently no protection in place, any user can do this
- They have also done the submission of user data a bit differently user axios, Ife warned them that they still need to use redux
- Next, Team 0 showed what we’ve done. We told Ife before we started that we wouldn’t be able to show much. Ife asked for us to differentiate users using types.
- We choose not to use cookies for our implementation compared to Team 1. We used jwt tokens instead.
- Ife warned us to not merge into his branch until requested, only merge into the local branch
- Ife told us that the next step after the authentication is to handle file upload, this will be done with a specific javascript package called multer.js
- Ife wants to go with the cookies route of implementation  for now done by Team 1. 
- Team 2 showed what they’ve done. They demonstrated the different login information required by the user, as well as the different views that an admin will see as opposed to a regular user
- There implementation was similar to the other 2 teams, but they had a bit more protection in place.
- Ife asked why team 2 also chose to not use cookies, their reason was that they simply found that implementation first before cookies
