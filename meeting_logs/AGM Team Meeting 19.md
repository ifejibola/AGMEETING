**Project**

Progress:

- More tests were made for the features we have completed
- Have the skeleton for the report laid out and have a pretty good idea how we will get it done

Problems:

- Ife expects us to do more work past April 8th, we have told him we are not expected to work past this date however
- We worry with the difficulty of the tests that we won’t be able to test everything efficiently enough

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- For the rest of this week, we will work solely on the report. This will look similar to the past reports, with some adjustments to account for our missing features
- Mason chose to write the user groups and description
- Adam will work on the technical specifications 
- Reid will add the 2 DFDs 
- Riley will work on the functional requirements
- And the rest of the report we will work on together as needed

Goals for next time:

- Ife would like for us to meet up and present to him sometime next week. We told him that we can do Monday or Tuesday
- With the report finished, we will spend our time preparing for finals and preparing the presentation on April 29th
