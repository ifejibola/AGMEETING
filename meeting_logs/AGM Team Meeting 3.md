**Project**

Progress:

- Talked to professor about ways we can fix are issues with the client, should have a response in Fridays meeting
- Finished requirements video and have responded to others
- Have gotten material UI zip file from client

Problems:

- Still no coding done for the client
- Communication with client is slow and time consuming

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Do requirements pdf, answer questions from other students
- Peer reviews

Goals for next time:

- Have clearer, more attainable goals from the client
- Material UI stuff should be looked through and understood
- Work from the forked github from client instead of our temporary one
