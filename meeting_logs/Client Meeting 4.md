- Changes made to Ife’s github, installed Material UI, made the layout, menu section
- Told to start tasks and subtasks on Jira
- In the components folder of the unzipped material UI, there are pre-built components that we can work off
- Given demonstration on how to use Jira to assign tasks, go to backlog, add tasks to start a sprint, set a duration, create subtasks, etc.
- Expected requirements for now are to integrate things from material UI into the wireframe which will be provided by Ife
