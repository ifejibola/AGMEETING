\*Notes taken by Adam

- Ife explained how he wanted the file upload to work for the system: He wanted us to allow moderators to upload and for users to download
- The system should assign users to a specific moderator when starting the meeting
- When users are assigned, they should be able to send messages to that moderator only and the other users under that moderator
- Ife also asked us to email him when would be a good time to meet with Barry for our final evaluation in April
- Ife said that a Sunday or Monday would be the preferable day, but any time in the morning or afternoon should work
