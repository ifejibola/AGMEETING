**Project**

Progress:

- Adam has tried to work with sequalize on his own time 
- Riley has set up a postgresql document for us, which will allow us to host our own database with pgadmin
- Mason has gotten our presentation powerpoint and Gantt chart set up for the presentation, however the presentation was delayed
- Reid has not done much, other then keeping the meetings documented 

Problems:

- Ife had cancelled the meeting on Friday that we were supposed to have, so we are taking things into our own hands
- Ife has also not yet sent us a requirements sheet for our next 2 peer evaluations so we could not do the presentation this week either

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- We will each start working on setting up our PSQL server
- Adam and Riley have started work on the admin, moderator, and participant table
- Mason will work on the meeting table 
- Reid will work on the Item table 

Goals for next time:

- ` `As always, we hope Ife can give us more direction after our meeting
- If not, we might start working on authentication
