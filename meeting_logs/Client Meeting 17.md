- Ife asked if we had made anymore changes since the last meeting. We told him that we mainly focused on testing, bug fixing, and working on the report as opposed to working on new features
- Ife was wondering what was the preferred time we would like to present to him. He says he would prefer sometime Monday or Tuesday in the morning 
- Upon hearing about the report we are working on, Ife asked if we would also send him a copy once we have finished, we all said that we could
- Team 2 seemed like they were having more issues then the other team, and was asked to stay behind when the other two teams left
