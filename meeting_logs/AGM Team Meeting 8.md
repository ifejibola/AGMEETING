**Project**

Progress:

- Finished the peer testing presentation and video, now need to work on the report
- Have gotten a response from Ife that we will start with the backend soon, just need to finish up front end, told us to make an ER diagram from the AGM handbook

Problems:

- Have not gotten enough to work with for the next git stats, might have to inform the professor

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- We each will work on a part of the peer test report as listed in the criteria:
- Adam has already done a bar graph of the heuristics and explained the results
- Reid will make a list of the issues discovered and ranked them based on priority
- Riley will create a brief description of our system and its features, as well as make a table of participants, their administrators, and the status of the evaluation
- Mason chose to explain the user groups we chose and their list of tasks. He has also said he will help Riley if he needs it

Goals for next time:

- With next week being only a partial work week, we don’t expect do have much else to do
- Possibly have more work from Ife on the frontend side
