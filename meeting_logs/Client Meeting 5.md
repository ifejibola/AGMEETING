- Routing seems to be not working correctly for some components
- Themes are being properly worked in
- Ife explained webpack, it is a one pack file that generates bundles
- A plugin is used in conjunction with the webpack to get the index.html template
- Main.js routes to other files, simply for clarity
- All teams had focused on replicating the webpages, a lot of people are new to react so it is slow going
- Ife has suggested we check out his react cheat sheet that should answer some of our questions
- The solution of copy pasting components from the devias kit seems to be what Ife wants us to do, since we have the sidebar working, we shouldn’t have as many issues
