- We told him that we have investigated Passport somewhat, but it’s been difficult without the starter code
- Ife was having audio issues during the meeting, he couldn’t here us, and we couldn’t here him for a while
- We asked Ife what he had used in conjunction with Passport, he said that he just used standard cookies

- Ife has sent us a tentative list of tasks that he will want done for our assignments
