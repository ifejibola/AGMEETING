**Client Meeting 1 – AGMeeting**

Sept.24/21

Start Time: 10:00am pst

End Time: 10:36am pst

- Ife Jibola is our contact for the company, 7 months of the key development phase of coding, will work with all three groups and help guide us
- Barry Rooke is Director, explained the ncra radio association, non profit
- AGMeeting started in 2016, funded through grant, audited, lots of groups use AGM use this program not just the radio association
- Found through Roberts rules of order that AGM (virtual and in person) usual 4 hour meeting took 12 hours, this started the endeavor to do more electronically
- By 2016 everything was in place, then it broke, our job is to update and get it working again
- Each group is working on 1 set of features, which will be merged in by Ife into the master
- In 2020, they worked with the school before on a different project, so they have some experience with the capstone program
- Given the website, notes about reducing work, being transparent, managing QA and auditing, etc
- Used best with people in person and online, works with other voice programs (Zoom, Skype, etc)
- Old system of AGM does have an old demo which does work, despite the full program not working (need 3 people, one moderator, 2 participants)
- Major features will be the authentication system and proxy voting, others are organizing meetings without the manager interfering
- Authenticator done, front end stuff nearly done, mainly working on backend with sql on it
- Main bulk of work will be on back end through **Javascript, Node.js and React**, talking through github and email (ife@ncra.ca)
- We want everything to work through the main desktop app, most through other platforms
- Sprint will be very integral to development, ncra will be doing sprints along side us
- First few weeks will be less intense, setting things up mostly, then we’ll get into core development
- Given handbook on everything about AGM, after we read the document we’ll start working
- The director will be in sometimes, only our director is required to be in and can give any feed back
- 10am Friday is a fine time for everyone, a google calendar will be set up to keep us on track, email will be sent with all the information when we start
- Some common problems that the last teams had in 2020, was communication with features and development speed, need to meet and discuss as often as possible
- They understand that we are still learning however, so they were lenient
- The teams thought through big problems rather then the small ones first
