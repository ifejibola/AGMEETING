**AGM Team Meeting 6**

Nov.17/21

Start Time: 12:30pm

End Time: 12:52pm

Attendees: Reid, Adam, Mason

Absent: Riley

**Project**

Progress:

- Got the second wireframe from Ife detailing the next 5 pages for the front end, will get a start to it in the following weeks

Problems:

- For the next peer evaluation, we will not have any backend to present, only front-end stuff. Prof will need to be made aware of this

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Split up the next 5 pages between us
- Adam will do navigation
- Mason will do general settings
- Riley will do content message
- Reid will do role call and the user stuff

Goals for next time:

- Have all pages assigned for teammates
- Possibly set up a dummy database to demonstrate for the presentation. Will work on this along side the 5 pages
