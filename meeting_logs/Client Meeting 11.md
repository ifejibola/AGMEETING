**Client Meeting 11 – AGMeeting**

Feb.11/22

Start Time: 2:15pm pst

End Time: 2:30 pm pst

    • Ife asked how the team was doing
    • Said alright, that we had made good progress on the login system
    • Also told Ife that we had the models created for the ER diagrams and that I believed we had implemented the changes discussed, but couldn’t be sure

    • Karan’s group say they are in a similar position with the models and connection
    • They used a different method to connect to sequelize, but it’s fine
    • Chester’s group also has API stuff done (or at least started)

    • Ife asked the groups to move to his database code, but to use our models
    • Not sure if required, it seems like we all have database connections now

    • We’ll be using Passport (Node library?) for authentication
    • Ife asked if anyone has used it, everyone said no
    • Ife already has the Passport code, says he’ll post by “Sunday, Tuesday at the latest”
    • Any comments, concerns, ideas for speeding things up email Ife

Karan – What should we have for next week? Should we have login for next week with or without
password?
Ife – Passport should have login support, just read through my code.
Karan – Sounds good yeah
