**Project**

Progress:

- Our authenticator is operation, but there is currently no distinction between a participant and a moderator
- We’ve also utilized PGadmin to further develop a basic outline of our database

Problems:

- No meeting with Ife during break, left to work on what we think is appropriate for the system

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Focus is shifting to the peer evaluation, over the next few days we plan to tweak stuff a bit, develop a script from our user tasks, and update our heuristic evaluation based on feedback from the user task list
- After the peer evaluation, we will also be making a short video going over the changes we’ve made since the last peer evaluation

Goals for next time:

- We will continue to iterate on our database design and authentication system for now, we hope in Fridays meeting Ife will provide us with more instruction
