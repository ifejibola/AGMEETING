**Project**

Progress:

- Started preliminary research on socket.io and PSQL
- Have investigated what Ife has done and github, not done any testing yet

Problems:

- Ife has yet to provide us a list of what he expects for the next 2 milestones, presumably it will be entirely focused on backend work, but he hasn’t provided us with further details.

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Each of us will continue working on our research tasks from last week until we know more from Ife on Friday’s meeting

Goals for next time:

- ` `After Friday’s meeting, we plan to start work on a 3-4 page summary for the presentation on Monday
- This will include, each feature the team will implement, smaller tasks for each feature, and who will be working on what (Optional)
- It was also suggested that we could make a Gnatt chart for the presentation as well
- We plan on all attending this presentation on Wednesday
