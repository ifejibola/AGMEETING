**Project**

Progress:

- Our messaging system has been fully implemented, and we have finalized most of the features that we can
- Some tests have been made using jest. Adam has made a test for the verifyToken method so far.

Problems:

- With the deadline of April 8th, we figure that we can no longer implement new features in time, as we aren’t expected to work past this date
- We need Ife to tell us what we would have implemented to address it on the report, we are only able to speculate right now.

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- We plan to continue to make enough tests for all relevant features. This is a part of the overall report that we will also be completing throughout the week
- During the meeting with Ife, we hope to have everything straightened out in time for our final evaluation 

Goals for next time:

- If the report isn’t done already, we will continue to work on it up until the deadline.
