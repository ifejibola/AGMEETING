**Project**

Progress:

- We’ve made some usability tasks related for authentication, but we figure that we need around 10-20 by Friday

Problems:

- Ife has not provided us documentation or examples for Passport yet, so we need to do our own research on the program

**Plan**

Task for this week:

- Adam will work on doing some initial setup for Passport
- Riley will work on creating a create account page for the login
- Mason and Reid will work on Passport documentation until Ife has provided us with something proper

Goals for next time:

- Once our usability tasks have been completed and approved, our next major task would be to set up our second peer evaluation in march
