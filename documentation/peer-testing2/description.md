# Peer Testing #2 Description

For this milestone, we have been working on improving the frontend, as well as implementing backend functionality, such as login and registration for users, in addition to models, GET and POST APIs for Participants, Moderators, and Admins. For this peer testing session, we were focused on getting a heuristic evaluation of the login and registration functionality in our project.

Various models we implemented include a participant model, admin model, moderator model, meeting model, and item model. GET and POST APIs were created for each model. GET APIs were updated to include various ways to retrieve data, such as based on email and password, or a meeting ID. 

We asked participants to navigate to the registration page to create a new user account, as well as logging in with that specific user account. After logging in, we had participants view specific pages and components to test their functionality. Participants made note of what particular aspects of our application could be improved, and those changes will be implemented for the final version of the project.
