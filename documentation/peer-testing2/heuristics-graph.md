# Heuristics Graph

### Heuristic Evaluation Comments

#### Positives

- Visually very pleasing and clear
- UI is easy to follow. Alert system attracts attention and the login and registration popups are appreciated.
- simple, intuitive, resembles other design practices
- UI design is very well made and visually appealing. Buttons and features are placed intuitively. Login page is very
  consistent with other applications.
- It's got a very pleasing design and is quite consistent. The functions that are implemented so far work as expected.
- UI follows convention, looks clean. layout most minus agenda new button. colors are snappy.

#### Negatives

- There were like 3 settings buttons all with the same icon which is a tad confusing but overall no complaints
- Could use a pi chart in the agenda voting screen.
- coloring - purple on blue. location of the add button on the agenda page. certain names such as "vault" were unclear.
- I advise revamping the interactions menu. Perhaps break some of them up and add more buttons to the side bar,
  particularly the voting system
- Clicking the "check all" button on the list doesn't select all items in the menu
- Either more intuitive ways of accomplishing tasks or documentation/manual
- some of the element names can be confusing to someone using the page for the first time (item/session). The function
  of the interactions button is not immediately clear
- all icons need to be changed to represent the actual function. new agenda button RTL needs to be removed. you arent
  supporting laguages that need RTL so it can go.

### Heuristics Evaluation Plot

The above figure is the graph of the quantitative scores received from the surveys completed after our peer testing
sessions. We had eight participants. The heuristics are represented based on the ordering of this article Nielsen's 10
Usability Heuristics, the last bar, represents the combination of the final two heuristics due to their similarity.

Based on the results we received from our survey the usability heuristics for our application are in a very good spot.
There are three main heuristics we should work on improving: error prevention, flexibility and efficiency of use, and
helping users recover from errors/help and documentation.

Based on the comments from the Heuristic Evaluations Improvements figure, it is clear that these comments match with the
quantitative data received from the surveys. Specifically, the comments related to providing better instructions and
help to users, are an indication of the error prevention heuristic, and the helping users recover from errors/help and
documentation heuristic. These are key areas we need to focus on improving. Secondly, the comments related to visibility
and reformatting some UI components to make a userâ€™s usage of the software easier, are related to the heuristic: the
flexibility and efficiency of use, which we will be looking to improve for the final report.

As seen from both the comments and quantitative data, we have a clear understanding of where we should focus our
improvements in our UI as our current functionality performed as expected.
