# Peer Testing 2

https://forms.gle/RZJ3DZQEGm4oqjmL8

### Goal of the application:

- AGMeeting is a meeting application designed to simplify the process of company meetings. There are 3 different
  possible users of the software at any given time: Participant, Moderator, and Administrator. One of the main
  functionalities of the software is to facilitate efficient communication during meetings through the use of an
  interactive agenda. The Vault page allows participants to easily access any documents that the Moderator or
  administrator wishes to share with participants. The moderator sets up the meeting structure by adding items to the
  agenda and then the participants use this agenda to vote or discuss various items or proposals. The target user group
  for this software would be mid to large scale companies that have meetings frequently, as well as companies that have
  employees traveling that can participate remotely.

### Peer Testing 2 Notes

- Lots of space around the add item button on the agenda page
- Fix theme selection background after changing it to the dark mode
- Interactions can be hard to find.
- Switching text direction caused a slowdown on the website.
- Hyperlink color for login/Register/AGMEETING needs to be changed
- Session page is unclear and cluttered, could use an explanation/documentation
- Votes component needs to specify item being voted on
- Vault page needs explanation/documentation for users. Page is unclear
- Interactions modal cluttered and color scheme is too unified.
- Interactions makes no sense.
- RTL very laggy and the purpose doesn’t make much sense.
- The difference between session and agenda page doesn’t make sense.
- Icons for sidebar are misleading, should be updated
- Comments in logged in/ registered users super unnecessary… doesn’t make sense why they are there
