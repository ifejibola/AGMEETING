# Requirement Report Group Evaluations

All members of the team contributed to each of the group evaluations.

### Laboratory Information Management System

- Slides are neatly organized, not cluttered and I like that no one is reading directly from the slides making the presentation more professional. Everyone presented concise and clear and all the members that presented spoke clearly, were easy to understand and follow; however, the level 1 data flow diagram was a little difficult to read. Also, who are your target user groups for the project? 
- The functional and non-funtional requirements of the project are not clear. How do they differ? At what particular milestones will they be implemented?

### Laboratory Information Management System (1)

- Content is not directly read from the slides, which makes it easier to connect to the audience and makes the presentation more professional; however the presentation was black text on a white background, so I suggest implementing a theme for a more visually appealing presentation. Everyone presented at a good pace, although some presenters were more difficult to hear than others. Maybe some volume could be adjusted? The functional requirements could be more detailed. 
- Addionally, a few questions that came up during the presentation: Where is your other data flow diagram and does it accurately represent the flow of data? What are your non-functional requirements? What is your testing strategy?

### Laboratory Information Management System (2)

- This presentation was very well done. The content seems thoroughly researched (as much as it can be at this point in the project), and the presentation was neatly organized with a consistent theme and good audience engagement. Images were used adequately for a visually appealing presenation. All parts were included, and their descriptions and explanations were very detailed, although the presentation seems to be missing another data flow diagram. 
- Some slides were mildly cluttered, maybe a little bit too much text, but this was no major concern. Andrew was a little harder to follow, and it almost seems like his part was rushed. Additionally, some questions that came up during the presentation: How does taking an agile approach lead to fragmented output? What do you mean by this? Will other forms of testing be implemented as well?

### AGMEETING

- We would have liked to see a more in depth analysis of the user groups for this software. Is everyone using the 
  software going to be interacting with it in the same way? HOw will different meeting sizes affect usage of the app? 
  How will users be using the app for different meeting types?
- When talking about scalability in the non fucntional requirments section we were curious about your group's aproach to handling
  the participation limits for the meetings. Is there a cartain capacity threshold that the application should support? How will 
  your group be handling larger meeting sizes?

### AGMEETING (2)

- We would have liked to see more detail for your target user groups. You mentioned that this software would be used 
  by any kind of company looking for a meeting supplement. How are different sized companies going to use the software 
  differently? Is there any other potential users other than companies?
- The functional requirements were outlined well in this video.
- In your testing strategy you mention that TravisCI will improve performance and efficiency but there is no further 
  elaboration on the techniques used. How will TravisCI improve efficiency? Is there any other tecniques used other 
  than automating testing and building?

### CHECKLICK

- Good use of integrating a demonstration of the Checklick application within the video. How do you plan to fulfill your goals of improving the UI? How do you plan on gathering feedback data as well?
- The audio for the presentation needs balancing as certain members are too loud or quiet. It's mentioned that your other goals are to make it easier to maintain as well as improve performance. How do you plan on doing so? What do you plan on doing to improve upon these aspects?

### CHECKLICK (1)

- The description and user groups were presented clearly and was informative. It did run long and could be shortened in some areas such as with the functional and non-functional requirements. It is mentioned in the DFD Milestones that peer testing will occur. Who exactly is the target audience for the peer testing? How many people will participate? How will you compile and use this feedback data?
- Your goal is mentioned to be in improving the process and making the application more intuitive for the user. How do you plan on doing so? What are some of the features that you will be adding or modifying that are part of your scope? Do you have more concrete details on what will be part of the "revamp" apart from what is mentioned?

### CHECKLICK (2)

- The video was quite informative and everything was presented in a clear manner. The DFD however, was missing from the presentation. How does information flow through the system? How is it stored or processed along the way? What does the level 0 and level 1 DFD look like?
- There are extensive plans on the redesigning and restyling of the application website. Are there any plans on incorporating client or user feedback on the features of the project during the development phase?

### Cyclops

- The functional and non-functional requirements were presented in a clear and concise manner, the presentation did run
  long but was very informative. The user’s score was mentioned fairly often throughout the presentation, it was a
  little unclear how this score was calculated. Does the user calculate the score, and input it themselves? Is it
  calculated based on their responses to questions they answer?
- The presentation provided the pros and cons of multiple platforms very clearly. It made it easy to understand why the
  group chose to work with Ionic for this project. It was unclear if Ionic with Angular is the only technology needed
  for this project? Will you be using something for the backend/database? Are you only building the app itself and will
  be interacting with an existing backend?

### Cyclops (1)

- The visual of the eco-tracker was helpful and made the purpose of the mobile app much clearer. In terms of the
  eco-tracker, security is important when it comes to a user’s data. What data will need to be collected for the
  eco-tracker to work as expected? How will the software ensure security and protect the user’s data? What
  authentication will be used to protect it?
- It was interesting that Ruby on Rails provides options for easy unit testing of the group’s code. It was mentioned
  that code would need to be reviewed before being merged which greatly helps with preventing bugs, and other issues. It
  was not as clear what other forms of testing would be implemented in the project. Will continuous integration be
  implemented to ensure that new code does not break the main build? Will integration testing be implemented?

### Cyclops (2)

- The differences between the target user groups were presented clearly, it was very clear what users should be able to
  do, and what the administrators should be able to do. It was unclear what the difference is between individual users
  and organizations, this was mentioned as two categories of the user group but was not elaborated upon. How do these
  two groups differ in terms of what they are able to do in the app?
- The different types of testing were clearly explained in the presentation, automated testing was mentioned and the
  different types were explained. The group mentioned that continuous integration would be used. It was not clear what
  types of automated testing the group is planning on using in the project, or if they plan on using multiple types. How
  will continuous integration be implemented to ensure the code works as expected before merging in new features?

### Ethics Dashboard

- We were unsure about the testing strategy mantioned in the video. Will your group be solely relying on rollbacks to combat 
  code conflicts? Is there any type of continuous integration tool that will be used? How will incoming code be tested before it 
  can be merged into the existing codebase?
- In your functional requirements section the requirements for the dashboard were well organized into the milestones listed. However, 
  the project description mentioned that teachers would be able to grade and review student work and this feature did not appear in any 
  of the milestones listed. When and how do you plan on implementing this feature?

### Ethics Dashboard (1)

- The tech stack indicated was well explained and documented, however, there was no alternatives supplied or reasoning as to why these specific 
  languages/frameworks were chosen. Is there any other options that your team discussed for the tech stack? Why did your team make the decisions you did?
- It is mentioned in your DFD that potential users of the app will go through a login phase in order to access their own specific dashboards. 
  How will the non functional requirement of security be handled? what steps will your group take in order to ensure that the databases for student work, 
  as well as their login credentials, are protected?

### Ethics Dashboard (2)

- We would have liked to see a bit more explanation into the chosen tech stack, especially the rationale behind the chosen frameworks/languages. Is 
  there other options that your group considered? How will the chosen tech stack be the best possible option for your client?
- The level 0 DFD is HUGE. Consider scaling back a bit as this level of DFD is meant to only show one node containing the process and its connection 
  to externalities (client, admin, etc.) Too much information here.

### Medical Image Matching

- Everyone presented at a clear and concise pace. The presentation had a nice, simple, and consistent theme. The tech stack section of the presentation shows that your team did research before making an informed decision and the data flow diagram was detailed and accurately represents the flow of data. Functional and non-functional requirements are well formulated; however, the unit testing part of the presentation was too cluttered with text. 
- Who are your user groups and how will different user groups interact with the application? Is there a security aspect to matching medical images if it involves patient data?

### Medical Image Matching (1)

- Nice, clean, simple theme for the presentation, and everything was well articulated and easy to follow. The introduction was strong and to the point. Pros and cons of each tech stack are well documented, demonstrating that much thought was put into researching tech stacks. The testing strategy of the presentation documents a clear progression for the development of the project. The data flow diagram could be more detailed. The non-functional requirements section of the video presentation seemed short and could be further expanded upon. 
- Which library will you actually be using for the project? How will you ensure your data is secure? 

### Medical Image De-Identification

-There seems to be a bit confusion with the level 0 and level 1 DFDs. The server and DICOM files are located differently within the process. How does the application and its processes individually interact with external entities such as the database and file system? How does the data flow through the Orthanc server?
-The milestones for the project are fleshed out and well thought. It is mentioned that your aim is to complete all functional requirements. The only one right now is the de-identification and anonymizing aspect of the application. Are there more details on these requirements? How does the app have to behave and what functions should be implemented in order to meet this criteria?

### Medical Image De-Identification (1)

-The current process and problem is well explained within the video presentation. Regarding your tech stack, you have detailed the pros and cons of the two programming languages. What build tools or libraries will you be utilizing to progress with your development?
- You have outlined the testing methods you will be using for the project, although it is not clear how exactly you will be performing these tests and how the code will be maintained in the future. What kind of testing environment will you be using for these tests? How will you assure that there is quality assurance? Will the application be easy to maintain and how so?

### Medical Image De-Identification (2)

- The presentation is well presented and easy to read, although it is unclear what your requirements are. What are your functional requirements as well as the non-functional requirements for your project?
- Testing strategies are also mentioned with your project presentation. Although it is present and thought out, what are your plans and goals for meeting quality assurance? What do you need to achieve in order to meet quality assurance requirements?

### woo woo network

- It seemed that your requirements are well-developed, although as a group we were unsure what the current issues are
  with the backend. Will you be required to write the entire backend from scratch, or will you be modifying the existing
  backend to improve it? If the backend is being written from scratch what made you choose to go with PHP for the
  language?
- The testing was fairly straightforward and will ensure your code behaves as expected. The only section that we were
  unsure about is how you were going to implement integration for your testing. Were you planning on implementing
  continuous integration in GitLab/Digital Ocean?

### woo woo network (1)

- The presentation provided a very clear description of the target user groups, and how they will interact with the
  website. The presentation mentioned that both user groups can register/log in. Will there be any measures in place to
  ensure that only verified healers can register as healers on the website?
- The presentation presented all the technologies that will be used for the project. In terms of security, it was
  mentioned stripe would be used for payments. How does stripe handle security and ensures that a user’s payment details
  remain secure? How will the website ensure a patient’s health records remain secure? Is there anything you will need
  to implement to ensure that everything remains secure?

### woo woo network (2)

- The presentation was clear that the users will be able to request a booking. How are these bookings managed within the
  system? What will prevent other users from booking an appointment at the same time? Will this be handled by a human,
  or by software?
- The presentation very clearly stated the processes the team will follow for all aspects of testing. It mentioned the
  technologies that would be used for back-end testing. What framework/technologies will be used to test the front-end?
  Will you be automating the regression testing or will it be done manually?
