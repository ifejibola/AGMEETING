# Peer Testing #1 Description

For this milestone, we have been working on implementing UI components based on the wireframes we have received from the
client. The focus from the client has been to only work on the front-end. Following the implementation of the components
in the wireframes, we will then begin working on backend functionality as requested by the client. For this peer testing
session, we were focused on getting a heuristic evaluation of the UI in our project.

We currently have implemented approximately 13 pages/components. These are as follows: welcome page, login page,
registration page, in-session page, agenda page, vault page, interactions page, registered user page, logged-in users
page, roll call modal, content message page, site settings, and meeting settings page.

The tasks we asked the users to complete were navigating the different pages and components, and performing the actions
on these pages. We wanted to determine how the navigation of our software worked, and how if the visual aspects of the
software make it easy to use for the user. Since we have not worked on the back-end yet as requested by the client, the
functionality of the pages is not implemented yet. This will be implemented in preparation for the next peer testing
milestone.
