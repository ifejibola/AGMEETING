# Week 8 Team Report

This week we spent time working on refactoring/cleanup of the repo to make it more organized and easier to work with. We
then worked on implementing the initial pages from the wireframe and information we were given. Some of these pages will
need more work as we found out more information about their expected behaviour.

### Carson's Tasks

- Worked on refactoring/cleanup of the repo.
