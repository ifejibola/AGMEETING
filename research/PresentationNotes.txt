Peer Testing 2 - March 2nd and 4th

Final Report - April 22nd


FIRST REQUIREMENTS MILESTONE

Peer Eval 2 (March 2nd, March 4th)
 - We must have our final build. 
 - We should have our final report planning started.
 - We could have our final report structure finalized and begun writing.
 - We don't have final sign off or a completed report.

Final (April 22)
 - We must have a complete report. 
 - We should have nothing left to do.
 - We could have some final work to do to finish up communication with the client.
 - We don't have any more work to do :)

NEW REQUIREMENTS MILESTONE

Peer Eval 2 (March 2nd, March 4th)
 - We must have our service functional.
 - We should have little to no remaining work, mostly focused on fixing issues from the second peer test.
 - We could have final deployment and not be running locally.
 - We don't have much in the way of the final report, but that's alright.

Final (April 22)
 - We must have a complete report. 
 - We should have nothing left to do but add the work we've done to our portfolios!
 - We could have some discussion with the prof and client about what we've done, what went well, and what didn't.
 - We don't have any more class work to do, only wrapping up our finals and other classes.

Specifically, I believe the next few weeks will look like this:

Jan 31 - Feb 4: Database implementation, hopefully Ife has a PSQL database for us to work with. Presentation on Wed.
Feb 7 - Feb 11: Socket integration, clients might be able to connect by the end of the week but may need more work.
Feb 14 - Feb 18: Finishing socket integration, making sure the service is functional but not bug free.
Feb 21 - Feb 25: Reading week, no work expected.
Feb 28 - March 4: Prep for Peer Eval 2, as well as conducting evaluations. No work is likely to get done this week. Video demo due.
March 7 - March 11: Work on report and peer evaluation analysis, not much work is likely to get done on the project this week either.
March 14 - March 18: Work on fixing issues that came up during peer evaluation 2
March 21 - March 25: Testing, looking for edge cases. Work should continue on wrapping
March 28 - April 1: We should be considering how the final report will look at this point, as well as either deploying the service or cleaning up the repo.
April 4 - April 8: Code should be complete by this point, what that will mean will become apparent as we get closer to the date. Work on report.
April 8 - 25: Exams and Easter may take up most of our time, final work on report, video, and evaluations should be wrapping up.

Hopefully this is adequate for us to create a gantt chart from, as well as give us an idea of what we're going to need to ask Ife for each week. GHopefully *crosses fingers*
