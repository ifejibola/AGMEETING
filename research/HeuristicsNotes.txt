From the peer testing, we have identified three areas of consideration for more thorough analysis.

The lowest three categories were "The systems design is consistent with how other software is designed", "The design of the system is simple, clear, and aesthetically pleasing", and "When I get stuck, the system has help and documentation to help me figure out what I need to do"

The first two of these have already been largely addressed with the implementation of Ife's changes into the project. This has vastly standardized the look and feel of the project, and it is now much more consistant with other software which should also work to support the simplicity and aesthetic layout of the project.

The third point has not yet been added. A few proposed solutions to addressing this issue would include:

- A dedicated FAQ page
- Mouseover hints
- A mouseover link which will take the user to a relevant section of the FAQ
- Instructions at the top of each page as to its function
- Including a walkthrough on the landing page

Seeing as this was our lowest metric, I believe it requires the most focus when we work on resolving issues for the next round of peer evaluation.
